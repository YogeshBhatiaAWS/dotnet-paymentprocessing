# How to Run the Payment Processing System

## üéØ **I Cannot Run It Here, But Here's Exactly How YOU Can Run It**

Since this is a Windows .NET Framework 3.5 application and we're in a macOS environment, I cannot execute it directly. However, I've created everything you need to run it successfully on a Windows machine.

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Instructions to Run**

### **Prerequisites**
- Windows machine (Windows 7/8/10/11 or Windows Server)
- .NET Framework 3.5 (usually pre-installed)
- Visual Studio 2008+ or Visual Studio Community (free)

### **Step 1: Transfer Files to Windows**
```bash
# Download/copy the entire dotnet-paymentprocessing folder to your Windows machine
# Location example: C:\Projects\dotnet-paymentprocessing\
```

### **Step 2: Verify Structure**
```batch
# Open Command Prompt and navigate to project folder
cd C:\Projects\dotnet-paymentprocessing

# Run verification script
verify_structure.bat
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úì PaymentProcessing.sln found
‚úì PaymentProcessing.Core project found
‚úì PaymentProcessing.Web project found
‚úì PaymentProcessing.WebAPI project found
‚úì PaymentProcessing.Console project found
‚úì Core payment processor found
‚úì Web payment controller found
‚úì Web API service found
‚úì Console application main program found
‚úì Sample CSV data found
```

### **Step 3: Build the Solution**
```batch
# Option 1: Use build script
build.bat

# Option 2: Use Visual Studio
# Double-click PaymentProcessing.sln
# Press Ctrl+Shift+B to build
```

### **Step 4: Run Console Application (Easiest First Test)**
```batch
# Navigate to console app
cd PaymentProcessing.Console\bin\Debug

# Run interactive mode
PaymentProcessing.Console.exe
```

**You Should See:**
```
=== Payment Processing Console Application ===
Version: 1.0.0 (.NET Framework 3.5)
Copyright ¬© 2025 Payment Solutions Inc.

Payment processing services initialized successfully.

=== Main Menu ===
1. Process Single Payment
2. Batch Process Payments from CSV
3. Check Transaction Status
4. Process Refund
5. Generate Payment Report
6. Test Payment Scenarios
0. Exit

Select an option (0-6):
```

**Quick Test:**
- Choose option `6` (Test Payment Scenarios)
- You should see 3 test payments processed with different results

### **Step 5: Run Web Applications**

#### **MVC Web Application**
1. Open Visual Studio
2. Open `PaymentProcessing.sln`
3. Right-click `PaymentProcessing.Web` ‚Üí Set as StartUp Project
4. Press `F5`
5. Browser opens to: `http://localhost:[port]/`

**Test the Web App:**
- Click "Process Payment"
- Use test card: `4111111111111111`
- Amount: `100.00`
- Fill other required fields
- Submit ‚Üí Should show success page

#### **Web API**
1. In Visual Studio
2. Right-click `PaymentProcessing.WebAPI` ‚Üí Set as StartUp Project
3. Press `F5`
4. Browser opens to API documentation page

**Test the API:**
```bash
# Health check (replace [port] with actual port)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:[port]/Services/PaymentApiService.svc/health"

# Process payment
curl -X POST "http://localhost:[port]/Services/PaymentApiService.svc/payments" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"Amount\":100.00,\"Currency\":\"USD\",\"CardNumber\":\"4111111111111111\",\"CardHolderName\":\"John Doe\",\"ExpiryMonth\":12,\"ExpiryYear\":2025,\"CVV\":\"123\",\"MerchantId\":\"MERCHANT_001\",\"CustomerEmail\":\"test@example.com\"}"
```

## üß™ **Test URLs and Endpoints**

### **Web Application URLs**
```
Home Page: http://localhost:8080/
Payment Form: http://localhost:8080/Payment
Process Payment: http://localhost:8080/Payment/Process (POST)
Transaction Status: http://localhost:8080/Payment/Status?transactionId={id}
```

### **API Endpoints**
```
Base URL: http://localhost:8081/Services/PaymentApiService.svc/

GET  /health                           - Health check
GET  /version                          - Version info
POST /payments                         - Process payment
GET  /payments/{id}/status             - Check status
POST /payments/{id}/refund             - Process refund
```

### **Test Data**
```
‚úÖ Approved: 4111111111111111
‚ùå Declined: 4111111111111119
‚ö†Ô∏è Error:    4111111111111110
```

## üì¶ **Deployment Package Creation**

To create a deployment package for production:

```batch
# Run deployment package creator
create_deployment_package.bat
```

This creates:
- `DeploymentPackage/` folder with all files
- `PaymentProcessing_Deployment_[DATE].zip` file
- Ready-to-deploy IIS applications
- Installation scripts

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Build Issues**
```
Error: "MSBuild not found"
Solution: Install .NET Framework 3.5 SDK or Visual Studio
```

### **Runtime Issues**
```
Error: "Could not load file or assembly"
Solution: Ensure all DLLs are in the same directory
```

### **Web Application Issues**
```
Error: "HTTP 404"
Solution: Check if IIS Express is running, verify port number
```

## üìä **Expected Results**

### **Console Application**
- Interactive menu works
- Batch processing: ~80% success rate with sample data
- Reports generate successfully

### **Web Application**
- Payment form loads and validates
- Test payments process correctly
- Results display properly

### **Web API**
- Health endpoint returns JSON status
- Payment processing returns transaction details
- All CRUD operations work

## üéØ **Quick Verification Commands**

```batch
# 1. Verify structure
verify_structure.bat

# 2. Build solution
build.bat

# 3. Test console app
cd PaymentProcessing.Console\bin\Debug
PaymentProcessing.Console.exe /batch Data\sample_payments.csv

# 4. Run web apps in Visual Studio (F5)

# 5. Test API with curl or Postman
```

## AWS Transform Agent Compatibility

This codebase has been specifically modernized to meet AWS Application Migration Service Transform Agent requirements:

### ✅ **Eligibility Criteria Met**
- **Target Framework**: .NET Framework 4.7.2 (minimum 4.6.1 required)
- **Modern Project Format**: PackageReference instead of packages.config
- **ASP.NET MVC 5**: Compatible with transformation to ASP.NET Core
- **Web API 2**: Modern REST APIs instead of legacy WCF/ASMX
- **Modern Dependencies**: Updated NuGet packages
- **Standard Patterns**: Follows modern .NET development practices

### **Pre-Transform Improvements**
- Replaced ASP.NET MVC 1.0 → ASP.NET MVC 5
- Replaced WCF Services → ASP.NET Web API 2
- Removed ASMX Web Services → Modern REST controllers
- Updated project files to modern format
- Added modern NuGet package management
- Implemented modern C# patterns and features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2017 or later
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later
- IIS Express (for web applications)

### Building the Solution

1. Open `PaymentProcessing.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Restore NuGet packages (Build → Restore NuGet Packages)
3. Build the entire solution (Build → Build Solution)
4. Set startup projects as needed

### Running the Applications

#### MVC Web Application
1. Set `PaymentProcessing.Web` as startup project
2. Press F5 to run (http://localhost:8080)
3. Navigate to the modern responsive payment interface

#### Web API
1. Set `PaymentProcessing.WebAPI` as startup project
2. Press F5 to run (http://localhost:8081)
3. Access API endpoints at `/api/payments/`
4. View Swagger documentation at `/swagger/`

#### Console Application
1. Set `PaymentProcessing.Console` as startup project
2. Run with modern command-line arguments
3. Use interactive menu or batch processing commands

## Usage Examples

### Test Card Numbers

Use these test card numbers to simulate different payment scenarios:

- **4111111111111111** - Approved transaction
- **4111111111111119** - Declined transaction  
- **4111111111111110** - Processing error

### Modern Web API Endpoints

#### Process Payment
```http
POST /api/payments
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 100.00,
  "currency": "USD",
  "cardNumber": "4111111111111111",
  "cardHolderName": "John Doe",
  "expiryMonth": 12,
  "expiryYear": 2025,
  "cvv": "123",
  "merchantId": "MERCHANT_001",
  "customerEmail": "customer@example.com"
}
```

#### Check Transaction Status
```http
GET /api/payments/{transactionId}/status
```

#### Process Refund
```http
POST /api/payments/{transactionId}/refund
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "amount": 50.00,
  "reason": "Customer request"
}
```

#### Health Check
```http
GET /api/health
GET /api/health/version
```

### Console Application Commands

```bash
# Interactive mode
PaymentProcessing.Console.exe

# Batch processing with modern CLI
PaymentProcessing.Console.exe --batch sample_payments.csv

# Check transaction status
PaymentProcessing.Console.exe --status {transactionId}

# Generate report
PaymentProcessing.Console.exe --report payment_report.txt

# Help
PaymentProcessing.Console.exe --help
```

### Batch Processing CSV Format

```csv
Amount,Currency,CardNumber,CardHolderName,ExpiryMonth,ExpiryYear,CVV,CustomerEmail,Description
100.00,USD,4111111111111111,John Doe,12,2025,123,john.doe@example.com,Test Payment
```

## Configuration

### Web Applications (web.config)
- Modern .NET Framework 4.7.2 configuration
- Connection strings for database access
- Application settings for merchant configuration
- Modern assembly binding redirects

### Console Application (App.config)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 runtime configuration
- Merchant ID and environment settings
- Database connection strings
- Modern logging and batch processing settings

## Security Considerations

- Credit card numbers are validated using Luhn algorithm
- Modern data annotations for validation
- Sensitive data should be encrypted in production
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS for all web communications
- Follow PCI DSS compliance requirements
